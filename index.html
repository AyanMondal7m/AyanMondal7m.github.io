 <H2>Projects</H2>
 <H3>USB to TTL PCB</H3>
   <TD><LI>Title- Designing an isolated USB to TTL PCB using Altium</LI><BR>
  <LI>Duration- One Month</LI><BR>
  <LI>Team Size- Two</LI><BR>
  <LI>Tools Used- Altium</LI><BR>
  <LI>Description- The project’s aim was to design an isolated USB to TTL PCB that could be used for data transfer between the main Air Conditioner IDU PCB and customer <BR> Desktop or laptop. The PCB needs to provide isolation between the Data side and the Storage site so that spikes and other electrical issues at either site must not hinder the other site.</LI><BR></UL></TD></TR></TABLE>

<H3>Automatic Solar Panel Cleaning System</H3>
  <TD><LI>Title- Building an Automatic Solar Panel Cleaning System with the help of Analog circuits</LI><BR>
  <LI>Duration- One Month</LI><BR>
  <LI>Team Size- Three</LI><BR>
  <LI>Tools Used- Electrical motors and electronic circuits</LI><BR>
  <LI>Description- The project’s aim was to create an automatic self-cleansing solar panel system, which would require minimum maintenance. The system was controlled electrically <BR> without the use of any microcontroller reducing the cost and was based on analog circuit made with the help of transistor and relays. The project worked on the logic of Relay’s NO, <BR> NC and COMMON pins and capacitor’s charge retaining capacity.</LI><BR></UL></TD></TR></TABLE>

<H3>Automatic Solar Tracking System</H3>
  <TD><LI>Title- Building an Automatic Solar Tracking System with the help of Embedded programming</LI><BR>
  <LI>Duration- One Month</LI><BR>
  <LI>Team Size- Two</LI><BR>
  <LI>Tools Used- Arduino, Solar Panels, Gears, Shafts, DC Motor, Motor Driver</LI><BR>
  <LI>Description- The project’s aim was to create a solar tracking system with the help of Arduino and a dc motor with highest efficiency and minimal losses. The concept was based on a <BR> theoretical paper written by an employee of BHEL and was not conceptualised. With the help of my practical knowledge and my mentors’ theoretical knowledge, we were able to <BR> create a solar tracking system based on the current difference created due to the movement of Sun across the two horizon instead of using LDRs which require regular maintenance <BR> and repair. It was self-sufficient and did not require any external source for movement. The project is still functional at BHEL ASSCP Gwalpahari, Haryana.</LI><BR></UL></TD></TR></TABLE>

<H3>Temperature dependent speed control of a DC fan for cooling system</H3>
  <TD><LI>Title- Temperature dependent speed control of a DC fan for cooling system with the help of Embedded programming</LI><BR>
  <LI>Duration- One Month</LI><BR>
  <LI>Team Size- Two</LI><BR>
  <LI>Tools Used- Electrical motors, electronic circuits, Arduino Uno</LI><BR>
  <LI>Description- The project’s aim was to create an automatic temperature dependent fan for a cooling system. This was created with the idea of Machine Rooms, Engineering Rooms <BR> and other rooms where temperature needs to be maintained without the use of air-conditioners in mind. The airstream from the fan would act as a cooling agent and maintain the temperature <BR> of the room or the machine it has been installed on. The fan speed would regulate its speed accordingly as the temperature rises or falls thus creating an optimum temperature. <BR> It would reduce overkill and also optimize the power consumption. This concept was later also thought be useful in high end Dessert Coolers with automatic fan speed regulation.</LI><BR></UL></TD></TR></TABLE>

<H3>Inverter Technology Based Air Conditioner</H3>
  <TD><LI>Title- IPM Based solution for Inverter Technology Based Air Conditioner</LI><BR>
  <LI>Duration- Two Years</LI><BR>
  <LI>Team Size- Ten</LI><BR>
  <LI>Tools Used- Electrical motors, electronic circuits, Arduino Uno</LI><BR>
  <LI>Description- The project aims to build an inhouse inverter-technology based air conditioner. Inverter ACs consume less power than general fixed speed air-conditioners as ideally the <BR> compressor never shuts down in case of inverter AC’s, only its speed of rotation (i.e. cooling speed) is regulated throughout the room’s temperature cycle. The compressor never <BR> shuts down thus it saves the high power required during its startup like it does in Fixed Speed. The room temperature is also maintained at an optimum temperature, i.e. the set <BR> temp, as the speed of compressor is regulated as required. The controller units have been designed in-house by our team from scratch. From hardware to its end software, all has been <BR> designed solely by our team.</LI><BR></UL></TD></TR></TABLE>
